How to Configure Apache on DreamCompute Running Fedora or Centos
================================================================

Apache is the most widely used HTTP server on the internet, and we use it extensively at DreamHost as the default HTTP server for all hosting products.  You can use it for your DreamCompute instance as well, and the following information helps you install and configure it.

These instructions assume you run a Fedora- or CentOS-based system as they have their own specific configuration and file hierarchy.

Installing Apache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install Apache on your system, run the following command:

.. code::

    yum install httpd

The install process asks you to confirm if you wish to install any dependancy packages needed for Apache.  Confirm by entering "**y**" and hitting enter.  When it completes, the Apache HTTP server is installed.  To start it, you can run:

.. code::

    service httpd start

This may display an error about the lack of a configuration, but it will start anyways.

.. code::

    Starting httpd: httpd: apr_sockaddr_info_get() failed for centos65
    httpd: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name, using 127.0.0.1 for ServerName
    [  OK  ]

You likely want apache to start on boot, and this can be configured with:

.. code::

    chkconfig httpd on

If you visit the floating IP in your browser for your DreamCompute instance, you are able to see the 'getting started' page.  You can find this IP on the `Instances <https://dashboard.dreamcompute.com/project/instances/>`_ (IP Address column) or `Access & Security <https://dashboard.dreamcompute.com/project/access_and_security/>`_ (floating ips tab) panel pages.

*The default page displays the following when Apache successfully installs:*

.. code::

    Apache 2 Test Page powered by CentOS
    or
    Fedora Test Page

    This page is used to test the proper operation of the Apache HTTP server after it has been installed. If you
    can read this page it means that the Apache HTTP server installed at this site is working properly.

Apache Directories and Main Configuration Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The /etc/httpd2 directory
-------------------------

This directory contains all the configuration files for your Apache server, and symlinks to other parts of the Apache install such as the logs and modules directories.

.. code::

    [root@fedora20 ~]# ls /etc/httpd
    conf  conf.d  conf.modules.d  logs  modules  run

conf
----

This directory by default only contains the main Apache config file named "httpd.conf", and the "magic" file used for determining MIME types.  The httpd.conf file is the only user-editable file and is well documented what each part of it does.  For making additions to this file, you can edit it directly to add your changes but it is recommended to create new .conf files in the conf.d directory instead for ease of management.

conf.d
------

All files with the .conf extension in this directory will be loaded last by httpd.conf and in alphabetical order.  The default Apache install from Fedora and CentOS have different basic contents in these directories, but one common file is welcome.conf to load the default Apache startup page when nothing else is configured.  Additional files will be added here by the administrator to configure Apache for the sites and features needed.

conf.modules.d (Fedora only)
----------------------------

This directory contains configuration files only used for loading modules and their options.  It is recommended to make any non-standard modifications for modules in the conf.d directory instead.  CentOS does not have this directory, relying on the httpd.conf file or conf.d entries for changes to modules instead.

Virtual Hosts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Virtual hosts define each site so that Apache knows what it should do when it receives a request.  The Apache configuration process on Fedora and CentOS is less defined compared to the Debian/Ubuntu setups, which can allow for more flexibility.  For easier management it is recommended to create individual .conf files to configure specific services in the /etc/httpd/conf.d directory, however you are free to create the files and their contents any way you desire.

/etc/httpd/conf.d/welcome.conf
------------------------------

The welcome.conf file defines what Apache should do when it gets a request that matches no other virtual hosts.  If you only expect to have one site on your DreamCompute instance, you could use this file and no others if you prefer.  For those with multiple sites, this can be used to instruct the visitor that they may have done something wrong, or redirect them to another site.

/etc/httpd/conf.d/YOURSITEHERE.conf
-----------------------------------

* For each site you wish to configure, we recommended you name a file similar to your site name in the **/etc/httpd/conf.d/** directory.
* There are several example virtual hosts available on the `wiki.apache.org Example Vhosts page <http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/ExampleVhosts>`_ but you can view a basic one listening on port 80 (http) with custom logging here:

.. code::

    <VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName foo.com
    ServerAlias www.foo.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/www.foo.com

    CustomLog /var/log/httpd/www.foo.com-access.log combined
    ErrorLog /var/log/httpd/www.foo.com-error.log
    </VirtualHost>

Alternatively, if you wish to specify the ip instead of "**\***" you can use the following command replacing 1.1.1.1 with your real ip address:

.. code::

    <VirtualHost 1.1.1.1:80>

Managing virtual host files
-----------------------------

If you create a .conf file for each site and wish to enable or disable that site, all this would require is removing or moving that sites specific .conf file out of the /etc/httpd/conf.d directory and then reloading Apache.  Alternatively, you could comment out the entire file by adding "#" to the front of each line.  You can reload Apache via the command:

.. code::

    service httpd reload
