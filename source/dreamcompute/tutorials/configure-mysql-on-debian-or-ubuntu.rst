How to Configure MYSQL on DreamCompute running Debian or Ubuntu
===============================================================

MySQL is the worlds second most popular database engine (after SQLite) and a very common choice for a open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).  MySQL is an important part of LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stacks as well as other AMP stacks, and is supported by many web software packages.  MySQL is the only relational database software offered by DreamHost for its shared, VPS and dedicated hosting products, except for SQLite.  You can use it for your DreamCompute instance as well, and the following information helps you install and configure it.  These instructions assume you run a Debian- or Ubuntu-based system as they have their own specific configuration and file hierarchy.

Installing MySQL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Debian and Ubuntu sometimes offer multiple versions of MySQL in case your needs require a later version, however it is usually best to go with their defaults if no specific version is required.

Debian 7.0 wheezy:

* mysql-server / mysql-server-5.5 - default and only version available

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:

* mysql-server / mysql-server-5.5 - default version of MySQL 5.5
* mysql-server-5.6 - alternative version of MySQL 5.6

To install MySQL on your system, run the following commands with the desired mysql version, such as:

.. code::

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install mysql-server

The install process asks you to confirm if you wish to install any additional packages needed for this installation of MySQL.  Confirm by entering "**y**" and hitting enter.

.. code::

    # apt-get install mysql-server
    Reading package lists... Done
    Building dependency tree
    Reading state information... Done
    The following extra packages will be installed:
    libaio1 libdbd-mysql-perl libdbi-perl libhtml-template-perl libmysqlclient18 mysql-client-5.5 mysql-common mysql-server-5.5 mysql-server-core-5.5
    Suggested packages:
    libipc-sharedcache-perl libterm-readkey-perl tinyca
    The following NEW packages will be installed:
    libaio1 libdbd-mysql-perl libdbi-perl libhtml-template-perl libmysqlclient18 mysql-client-5.5 mysql-common mysql-server mysql-server-5.5
    mysql-server-core-5.5
    0 upgraded, 10 newly installed, 0 to remove and 1 not upgraded.
    Need to get 9,696 kB of archives.
    After this operation, 97.0 MB of additional disk space will be used.
    Do you want to continue [Y/n]?

Before the installation completes, a dialog will pop up asking you to specify a MySQL server root password.  The root user is the default admin user and should have a strong password.

.. code::

    Configuring mysql-server-5.5
    While not mandatory, it is highly recommended that you set a password for the MySQL administrative "root" user.
    If this field is left blank, the password will not be changed.
    New password for the MySQL "root" user:

If you enter a password, another dialog box will come up for you to re-enter the password to confirm.

When it completes, the MySQL server is installed and runs with its default configuration.

Configuring and Using MySQL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The configuration files are stored in the /etc/mysql directory.  If any changes are made, you must restart MySQL for it to read the them.  This can be done by running:

.. code::

    service mysql restart

Main configuration file /etc/mysql/my.cnf
-----------------------------------------

This is the main configuration file for MySQL.  There are a few settings you may wish to change:

* **bind**
    The ip address that MySQL is listening to.  It can only listen to one ip address at any time.  By default it will listen to 127.0.0.1 (aka localhost), meaning that the MySQL service will only be accessible from the instance it is installed on.  If you want to connect to it from other DreamCompute instances, you can change this to your instances IPv4 or IPv6 private ip address.  If you want to connect to it from anywhere and not just DreamCompute instances, you can provide the instances floating IPv4 address, or if the security group allows public IPv6 ingress/egress then your IPv6 address as well.  Here is what an IPv6 configured mysql bind variable looks like:

.. code::

    bind-address            = 2607:f298:6050:8a28:f816:3eff:fe62:c9c3

* **max_allowed_packet**
    The largest size allowed for a single packet, which normally is only relevant for restoring backups.  If a backup was created on a server with a high setting for this value, it may have difficulty restoring on another machine with a lower setting for this value.  The default is 16M.

Resetting the root password
---------------------------

If you forget the root password, it can be reset by running this command and entering in a new password twice.

.. code::

    dpkg-reconfigure mysql-server-5.5

Connecting to mysql shell
-------------------------

To connect to your new mysql install, to setup new databases or configure new users, you can run these commands.

Via socket (should work even if "bind" is changed in my.cnf):

.. code::

    mysql -S /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock -u root -p

Via IP address:

.. code::

    mysql -h 10.10.10.X -u root -p

Via localhost:

.. code::

    mysql -h localhost -u root -p

or just:

.. code::

    mysql -u root -p
